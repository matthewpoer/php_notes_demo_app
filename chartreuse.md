# (You Dyed Your Hair) Chartreuse
You're a freckled gal  
You're a pug-nosed cutie  
Sweet as Charlotte russe  
You've got big blue eyes  
So I ask you why  
Have you dyed your hair chartreuse?  

Chartreuse (chartreuse)  
Chartreuse (chartreuse)  
Though you think it's mighty cute  
Just wait 'til I write and tell your ma  
That you dyed your hair chartreuse  

Chartreuse (chartreuse)  
Chartreuse (chartreuse)  
Though you think it's mighty cute  
Just wait 'til I write and tell your ma  
That you dyed your hair chartreuse  

In the days of old  
When the knights were bolder  
And the girls were truer blue  
Just think what paw  
Would have said to maw  
Had she dyed her hair chartreuse  

Chartreuse (chartreuse)  
Chartreuse (chartreuse)  
Though you think it's mighty cute  
You went too far in that beauty booth  
When you dyed your hair chartreuse  

[Instrumental Break]  

Now you know I know  
That your hair was black when we lived on Chestnut Street  
When you wore pigtails  
And ginger ale was your most favorite treat  

You're a big girl now  
So you think it's cuter being fast and fancy-loose  
But you went too far in that beauty booth  
When you dyed your hair chartreuse  

Chartreuse (chartreuse)  
Chartreuse (chartreuse)  
Though you think it's mighty cute  
Just wait 'til I write and tell your ma  
That you dyed your hair chartreuse  

Chartreuse (chartreuse)  
Chartreuse (chartreuse)  
Though you think it's mighty cute  
But just wait 'til I write and tell your ma  
You didn't like black, you didn't like red  
You hated blondes, well, it's no use  
You got mad and dyed your hair  
Chartreuse
